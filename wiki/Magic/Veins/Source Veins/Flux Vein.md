**Flux Veins** are a subset of [[Source Veins]] which deal with fundamental, flux forces.

_Catalyst: Red & White Blood Cells/Flux_
Deals with sources of Flux, the forces that travel through. Flux forces (from weakest to strongest) include gravity, weak binding, electromagnetic, and strong binding forces. Flux Veins start only being able to Anchor to gravity; none have reached nor understand strong binding.

The strength of Flux Veins is that their Catalyst is just as important as the Founding/Controlling aspect of their power. Their usual Catalyst causes weariness and a high chance of infection, which is costly and cannot be quickly refilled like other Veins. Advanced Veins can convert Flux into Vis, become lighter, discharge electric charges, or even turn themselves into a nuclear bomb by ripping apart their atoms.

Flux Veins are the most spiritual and least stable of all the Veins. As such, they tend to switch around with personality, but many are driven, abstract, and intentional. Good for many jobs that require standing up for oneself, but struggle with the real ramifications of their actions. Often led by emotion and thought. _(The state: force itself, consistent, and ever-present.)_
## Fluxfounder
Amplifies any source of flux. Usually this is done just in connection to the user, but with more Vis it can be extended to others. With practice, a Fluxfounder can stick two objects together with an electron stream, spark electricity between two objects, strengthen the pull of gravity, or preserve something from time and Entropy by strengthening its weak binding flux. Bound to [[Wrath]].
## Fluxbinder
Changes the direction or quality of any source of flux. Like Fluxfounders, Fluxbinders can extend this effect to others. With practice, a Fluxbinders can convert static flux into magnetic and vice versa, change the direction of gravity, and absorb impact only to redirect it. Bound to [[Mastery]].
## Flux Forces
Research Machines on Wikipedia for some information about these.
### Gravity
All objects draw other objects towards themselves depending on their mass. More mass equates to more of a gravitational pull.
### Weak Binding
Responsible for radioactive decay; the tiring of one particle into another. 
> Strengthening this improves the resilience of materials against Entropy. It is also responsible for solar fusion and radioactive fission.
### Electromagnetic
Magnetic force, the Earth's electric field, and the generation of visible light. Through pushing the electromagnetic force, one could create X-rays.
> When an object gives up positive electrons to another object, they are drawn together. An electron stream keeps them connected, and the spark between them is giving them back.
### Strong Binding
Holds the protons and neurons in atoms together, while also slightly pushing them apart.
> Decreasing the strong binding forces in an object could turn anything into a nuclear bomb by ripping apart the protons and quarks on atoms. It would require the vein to be very close to the object, and this would be a suicide bomb.
