**Wave Veins** are a subtype of [[Source Veins]] which deal with waves.

_Catalyst: Hearing/All Senses (through touch)_
Deals with sources of waves. Wave Veins can Anchor to sources of vibration, the waves of gravity created by the moon, sound, and later radio/x-rays. They also technically can affect visible light, but in an unusual way.

Wave Veins are drawn to large, swathing ideas like philosophy and sociology. Tend to be quite forward, affecting all they can. Many are speakers and military commanders. _(The state: permeating, radiant, often misunderstood.)_
## Wavefounder
Can “grow” waves. Most start by amplifying sound, then reaching into other waves to communicate over long distances and vibrate objects enough to cause people to drop them. With practice, Wavefounder can create sonic waves loud enough to deafen. Bound to [[Rally]].
## Wavebinder
Can adjust waves. Able to capture waves and change the qualities (pitch, tone, length) of existing sounds. They are often known to create confusion in enemy ranks by interrupting speeches and creating strange sounds that only some people can hear. With practice, Wavebinder can vibrate two objects in parallel to create walkie-talkies. Bound to [[Conviction]].
