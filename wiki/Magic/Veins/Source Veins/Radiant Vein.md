**Radiant Veins** are a subtype of [[Source Veins]] which deal with photons.

_Catalyst: Eyesight/Body Heat_
Deals with sources of photons and heat. Most Radiant Veins only reach light itself, but with practice directing photons can create heat. Their Catalyst can advance to absorb all the light in a direction or area.

Radiant Veins are drawn to secrets, history, and change in the world. Often two-faced (wave and particle), not always in a bad way. Change themselves to what is needed, usually very multifaceted. Many are spies and lawyers. _(The state: multi-phased; a composite of many subsets, some parts of it are invisible.)_
## Radiantfounder
Can “grow” sources of photons. A Radiantfounder can blossom even a small flame, keeping weak sources alive indefinitely. With practice, a Radiantfounder can expand the inherent Radiance in an object enough for it to hear up. Bound to [[Hope]].
## Radiantbinder
Can redirect photons. Often begin by jarring surrounding photons, interrupting streams of them jumping into people’s eyes, creating visual “glitches” around them. With practice, a Radiantbinder can collect photons into a single form, called solid light, which has practically zero mass. Bound to [[Change]].
