**Source Veins** are a subset of [[Veins]] which deal with sources of physical phenomenon rather states of matter.

Rather than anchoring to specific objects, Source Veins see all sources of their effect and anchor to those. They tend to be much rarer than [[State Veins]], and the abstraction from physical states make Source Veins harder to understand and master. Also called Noble Veins after they were horded by the nobility of [[The Arden Alliance]].
