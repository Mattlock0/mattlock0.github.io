**Anchors** are a [[Magic]] in [[Northern Hearth]] closely related to [[Veins]]. They are the precursor—before a target can be Founded or Controlled, it must be Anchored to.
## Source
Anchors, like [[Veins]], are obtained hereditarily or from an [[Axis Fruit]]. All Veins have the ability to cast Anchors, but not all people with the ability to cast Anchors are Veins.

Anchors are a spiritual ability and cannot be seen physically. However, like [[Veins]], ones veins will light up when casting an Anchor.
## Mechanics
An Anchor is a spiritual connection between two physical things. Usually, it is between a sentient being (the source) and an object (the target). Anchors act like fishing line; there must always be a physical path between the source and the target. If the path is blocked, the Anchor snaps.

Anchors cannot be instantly established between a source and a target. They take time to travel through the spiritual dimension (and could be blocked by a spiritual object). However, once an Anchor takes hold, it wraps around the physical object to the exclusion of all other Anchors.

Casting an Anchor, like throwing a ball or spear, requires aim. You can miss. Mechanically, Anchors travel through the spiritual dimension until point where you choose to bring them into the physical dimension. At this point, they “pop” into existence and wrap around the object closest to its center. Beginners can only Anchor to things they can see, while later on they can sense for Anchor points around them by “feeling around” with an Anchor.
### Range
Beginners can only establish Anchors five feet away. This can be expanded to thirty feet with practice. Targets Anchored to that move out of this range are lost.

Anchors mostly follow a straight line to a target, but with practice they can be bent to reach around objects and corners.
## Targets
### Solid Targets
A solid target is considered “whole” or “one” for the purposes of Anchors if it is connected using chemical/molecular bonds, not mechanical ones. Chainmail and woven shirts are considered thousands of objects—a steel bar or rock is one. Sand and dirt can't really be Anchored to well because of how many Anchors it would really require.
### Fluid Targets
Fluid targets are a little different: rather than Anchoring to individual objects, these Anchors will use a “net” of sorts to hold the target. Just as solid anchors wrap around a target, fluid anchors will expand to fill the maximum space an Anchor can support, then establish itself and attempt to hold all the fluid particles inside. Anchors can be molded, slightly, at higher levels, but by in large they capture a sphere.

Advanced Anchors can capture small, particulate portions or a large swath of a fluid target. If the fluid is composed of two distinct fluids (such as oil and water), the Anchor will contain the fluid with particles closest to its center. These fluids are considered “distinct targets”.
### Source Targets
Source targets have a similar size limitation, where the Sun, Moon, or the Earth itself cannot be used as Anchors. However, they do not wrap around the entirety of a source like solid targets.

Most light/wave/force sources have a destination, or a path. Advanced Anchors can target just a small part of this path, up to their wrap around range, so as to connect with stronger sources. It is difficult, but a source Anchor could target the force affecting a specific object rather than the source itself.
## Limitations

## Losing an Anchor
If a Vein’s concentration is broken, their Anchor is lost. This can be through shock or unconsciousness. It hurts to get your Anchor cut. Spiritually. When this happens, the Anchor’s source might feel a sudden and crippling sense of loss. Having an Anchor cut could permanently reduce the number of Anchors you can create, depending on the cleanness of the cut. Scrapes still eliminate an Anchor but allow it to heal.
## Advanced Tactics
### Slow Burn
You can use Vis (like you would use your muscles) to throw an Anchor faster, but that Vis is used up in the throw and the Anchor is considered “lossy”. Warriors typically establish Anchors slowly overnight so their equipment is protected from other Anchors. If an object is split in half, an Anchor is lost. If less than 24% of the object is removed, the Anchor is maintained.
### Double Tap
You can overcome the little Vis/quick Anchor requirement by quickly lashing out an Anchor, using a small amount of Vis to “hold” that connection, and use the Rutted Potential that is created between you and the object to Anchor quickly with a lot of Vis. This leaves a small gap where you are not Anchored to the object in which someone could “steal” control.
### Markers
Some Veins have learned to attach a substitute Anchor to an object, then fire that object at something else. This creates a four-dimensional weapon of sorts which can puncture through existing Anchors. Should the projectile hit, the Marker can “transfer” the Anchor to the target.
### Twice Anchor
Connect two Anchors to one target. This allows a Vein to manipulate (Controllers), or access the Spiritual components (Founders) of an target. Supporting more than two Anchors on one target is essentially impossible.
