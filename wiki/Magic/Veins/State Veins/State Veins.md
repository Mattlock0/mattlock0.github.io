**State Veins** are a subset of [[Veins]] which deal with the states of matter.

State Veins are the most physical Veins. While there is theoretically a Plasma Vein, the catalyst does not exist within a person, so none exist. State Founders require a seed to grow—they do not actually create a “new” object. Further, any Founded portion of the object it is still encapsulated by an Anchor, which stretches like shrink wrap.
