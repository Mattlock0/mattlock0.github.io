**Solid Veins** are a subtype of [[State Veins]] which deal with solids.

_Catalyst: Food/Bone/Flesh_
Deals with materials in the solid state. Because of the nature of Will, Solid Veins have the easiest time Anchoring materials with little to no life in them. Materials like wood and dead flesh are _possible_ but require tremendous amounts of Vis (essentially impossible) to override the residual Spiritual energy remaining (colloquially known as the Echo of Life).

Solid Veins are the least Spiritual and most stable Veins. They are grounded, organized, and logical. Mostly realists, and stay away from things they do not understand, such as religion. Many are lawyers and police. _(The state: very structured and keep to themselves, somewhat slow, existing shape.)_
## Solidfounder
Can “grow” solids. Mostly metals, stone, and crystals. The more complex the material, the harder it is to replicate. With practice, a Solidfounder can grow solids into a particular shape. Bound to [[Endure]].
## Solidbinder
Can move solids. Adding in more Anchors can bend solids, mold them, and throw them. With practice, a Solidbinder can catch moving objects and temper metal/tan leather. Bound to [[Dominion]].
