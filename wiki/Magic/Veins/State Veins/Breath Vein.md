**Breath Veins** are a subtype of [[State Veins]] which deal with gasses.

_Catalyst: Breath/Blood Oxygen/Gases_
Deals with materials in the gas state. There are very few gases that cannot be Anchored, so Breath Veins have the widest range. However, they rarely encounter gases other than oxygen.

Breath Veins are the in the spiritual middle of the Veins, and tend therefore to be the most moral, drawn to grand, nebulous ideas with realistic applications. In this position, they can fall into the trap of creating their own moral code and enforcing it on the world. Many are radicalists and emissaries. _(The state: they fill any space they’re in; can change to fit any circumstance.)_
## Breathfounder
Can “grow” gases. Once created, gases spread out in all directions. With practice, a Breathfounder can replenish air through their skin and keep a constant barrier of air around them. Bound to [[Protect]].
## Breathbinder
Can direct gases. They start with little precision, but stronger Breathbinders can control gases in any way they like. With practice, a Breathbinder can control specific oxygen molecules. Bound to [[Sacrifice]].

Training: Consistent workout, breathing techniques, holding breath, continued exposure to a strong breeze, improving focus.
