**Liquid Veins** are a subtype of [[State Veins]] which deal with liquids.

_Catalyst: Drink/Blood/Fluid_
Deals with materials in the liquid state. Most liquids can be Anchored, but some like blood and algae are incredibly difficult due to the same problem Solids face. Poison is possible, but difficult.

Liquid Veins are mentally flexible but are prone to fall into tradition. Due to this, they tend to do best in organizations like schools and research, where they are required to advance but follow strict laws. _(The state: has no shape in itself; matches the shape of their surroundings.)_
## Liquidfounder
Can “grow” liquids. With practice, a Liquidfounder can replenish their stores from liquid directly and continue to make as much as necessary. Bound to [[Understand]].
## Liquidbinder
Can route liquids. It takes focus to lift a liquid out of a puddle. With practice, a Liquidbinder can separate different liquids and mix their attributes as they please. Bound to [[Retribute]].
