Veins are a byproduct of the Axis Singularity. Light and roots mixed to spread veins over the world, and the Caliber of [[Willpower]] and [[Fate]] bled together to create the new system of Caliber, Veins.

The ability to harness one’s veins is passed down hereditarily. It is an extension of the user’s body and grows as they do. While a Vein’s power begins weak, they can grow to accomplish incredible feats.

Veins require a catalyst; they vary for each type. The conversion rate of catalyst to Vis starts out poor, and lots of Vis from the catalyst is lost or rendered inert. Later, as their conversion grows increasingly efficient, Veins can be used more before having to replenish their catalyst. Each catalyst offers a template for the Vein to use, and it must be in the same state/source as the Vein manipulates.

Early Veins have trouble controlling something while moving. Their proprioception isn’t used to being Anchored to something else, and when they move the object either moves with them or the Anchor is lost. It is easier to mimic the motion you wish to Control with your hands so you can imprint the Potential on the object and your mind, but you don’t have to.

All Veins have both a physical and spiritual effect, though the latter is rarely understood at this stage.

Every Vein can see elements of what they affect. Breath Veins can see green currents in the wind, Liquid can see flow lines in the water, Radiant can see the directions of photons/difference in colors, Wave can see vibrations in the air, and Flux can feel prickles of flux forces and see the tiny bonds connecting them.

As you go down the list of Veins (Solid→Liquid→Breath→Radiant→Wave→Flux) the Veins go from physical to spiritual and stable to unstable.

Think of Veins as an extension of your body. It requires a level of strength to hold up your arm; same goes for an Anchor. It requires further strength to *lift* something with that arm; same goes for lifting an Anchored object. Both use muscle to achieve actions, but the advantage with Veins is that you can choose how and how much of each muscle is used.
## The Choice
The awakening point for a Vein. When under a moment which will determine their [[Fate]], persons with the Vein strand are presented with two choices by the Tree: Swear to change themselves and grow; or temper themselves and push through adversity. Their decision chooses which style of Vein they receive: Control or Founding, respectively.

This creates an Oath to the Tree, causing their Fates to be intertwined. A Vein feels a constant draw to the Axis Tree. During winter when the Axis Tree’s power dwindles, they become sluggish and weak as their Vis is stripped away to keep the Tree alive.
## Limitations
A Vein can only lift what their muscles are capable of. Most Veins just use the muscles in their arms, but you can use all the muscles in your body. There is some scaling for Breath, Radiant, and Wave but the rest follow it directly.

Without a connection to their Ideal, Veins are very limited by their Catalyst. Veins start quite weak, but using it improves the ratio.

If veins are cut while Vis is coursing through them, they will bleed out Vis and the Vein will all but certainly die. At best, that vein cannot siphon Vis again. But to use muscles from your body, you must siphon Vis to that part, thereby exposing yourself. It’s a double-edged sword. Sometimes, when a vein siphon Vis is cut, the Vein goes haywire and will use burn through its Catalyst at extreme speeds, usually killing the person.
### The Echo of Life
Veins work by temporarily granting an object Will, then directing that will to act as they wish. There is a spiritual property to Founding that stops it from growing anything that was once alive, as it _already has_ a level of Will directing it. These Veins attempt to reinvigorate what was lost rather than create more of it. As a result, materials like meat, plants, and bark are un-Anchorable without a tremendous amount of Vis. (at which point, the amount required to overcome that barrier would make a Vein useless)

Thus why two Anchors cannot be established to one object; if it is already full of one Vein’s Will, it cannot house another’s. Sometimes, the Will implanted within the objects leaves residual echoes, creating some things with an odd level of “intelligence”.

Just as there are living materials, there are also materials which, by some means of Willed investing, are Spiritually painful—like fire is physically painful—to hold. They change from person to person, but usually things of Entropy hurt before you grow Spiritual callouses. Then, things of Elligon will hurt.
## Advancement of Power
Veins must be used, like muscles, for them to be improved. Finer control, a better mass–Vis conversion ratio, and further range all come with practice. Some people are born better, but there are no heights that only some people can reach. A substantial portion of Vein training comes from working things that start as conscious decisions into natural, autonomous things.

Veins also learn to use certain muscles at different times, whether they need to keep running or hold something, or just to keep their heart beating. As they progress, Veins can use more and more of their muscles, up to their entire body. Obviously, this stops them from moving.

All Veins work in conjunction with the brain. The extent of their powers—and what they can achieve with them—is dictated in part by how they understand it. For example, if a Breathbinder believes air flows like water, they can control it that way. But if they were to understand it as a scattered molecular compound in gas form, they would be able to control it modularly.
### Withering
A Vein will reach a point where they have overextended their Veins, all the walls between them and their body grow weak. Overusing Veins can shorten lives, cause you to leak Vis, and stain your vessels the color of your Ideal.

It is widely understood that once the staining reaches your eyes or heart, your body will give one final push, then wither entirely, leaving you stunted or dead. Permanent effects of Withering include insatiable hunger/thirst, dulled/lost senses, migraines, insanity, atrophied muscles, thinning skin, heart palpitations, limbs that stop working, stunted growth, and inconsistent healing.
## The Rootless
There are a group of people whose parents did not have any attunement to a Vein, or some mutation caused them not to inherit any. These are called the Rootless, and when their Vis is aggravated, their veins glow a dull red. They have no power and cannot manipulate the flow of Vis within them. There is no way for them to gain a Vein, save for ripping out another’s Veined heart and veins and implanting them in their own body. A scorned group of people thought to have little use to society.
## Thoughts
### Attitude in War
Veins are highly valued by a regiment, primarily because you can't be forced to use them, and they can easily turn on their teammates if they wanted to. As such, they are paid well and protected in battle.

When facing Veins, the priority objectives are such: identity Veins, identify their types, then prioritize and capture/kill.

Below is a default priority list, should a commanding officer not be present:
1. Flux (C/F)
2. Solid (C)
3. Radiant (C/F)
4. Breath (C)
5. Solid (F)
6. Liquid (C/F)
7. Wave (C/F)
8. Breath (F)

Flux are by far the most dangerous, as their spiritual/unstable Resonance lets them easily connect to other living creatures.
