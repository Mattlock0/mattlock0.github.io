While not allowing completely autonomous use of veins, Roots do give a level of remote control. It takes an intermediate control of one's veins to make use of them. To create a lasting effect with roots, such as protecting an item from being connected to, or keeping a candle lit without fuel, one would have to do the following:
1. Start the process themselves, by connecting a Line to the object.
2. Preferably, this is done slowly so the Line is thin and uses little Vis to keep up the connection.
3. Transfer the *personal end* of the Line to the Root, just as you would connect a Line in the first place. (This is the hardest step and takes the most understanding to conquer.)
4. Then, the Root will continue the process to that *one object*, and will not stop until the Line is cut, the object is moved out of range (roughly 15 feet, depending on the size of the Root), or the Root is entirely used up. Instead of the user's Vis, the Root converts its own composition into energy to keep the connection. It will eat itself from the outside in.

Advanced uses might see a persisting bubble of founding/controlling in an area—which uses up the Root much faster—or chaining a series of Roots together to improve their range. Roots laid in a chain like this will use up the composition of the Root which holds the starting Line, thereby allowing a battery of sorts.

Although Veins are strictly used through the body, Roots can be combined to create effects that use a multitude of abilities. There is no "spell casting", but a science through which Veins can build into advanced mechanisms that act as magical structures. It is a delicate process, but with practice Rootless can utilize power, albeit in a limited sense.

The Roots in Southern Hearth absorb Vis instead of diffuse it. There is a recycling of Vis through this method; it is consumed in the South and spewed into the ecosystem in the North. Those in the South avoid the Roots as they suck up life force.
