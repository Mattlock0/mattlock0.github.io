**Din** is a [[Religion]] in [[Northern Hearth]].

Worshipers of the forgotten deity of Eldionus. While he is referenced as Elligon now or lumped in with the Weaver as “The Architect” in the godhead, the Din focus solely on the true god himself. While he is sealed away, the Din have very little to base their teachings on beyond the historical figure Tyrinn and the things he passed on. Their beliefs carry an inkling of the previous world of Atlas that was remade into Hearth.

The Din believe that Veins were result of a clash between good and evil, freedom and control. Their religion doesn't specify which of the two (founding or controlling) is evil, so they tend to be the most suspicious of Veins. Their priests are "Pure", meaning they are Rootless. A higher sect believes that taking the Third Choice is the purest, as you were tempted with evil and resisted.
