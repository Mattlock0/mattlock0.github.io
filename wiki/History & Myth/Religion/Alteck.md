**Alteck** is a [[Religion]] in [[Northern Hearth]].

Worshipers of the mythic being “Axis” said to be the origin of the similarly named Trees at the poles of their world. While this religion is one of the only ones still holding the knowledge of the second Axis Tree, their stories of its origin were mixed with Dimirius’ heroism and paint him as a man of divine power who made the Trees with his own hands. They believe Dimirius lays at the base of the Trees, and that they grow from his back. (Mormon, Eldin?)
