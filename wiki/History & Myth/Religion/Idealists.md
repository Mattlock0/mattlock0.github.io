**Idealists** is a [[Religion]] in [[Northern Hearth]].

People of Threyda who uphold and follow the Ideals as their primary goal. While much smaller than Vellheim, they too remember Eldionusâ€™ call to Paths. However, theirs are not Compound and thus their focus is on becoming Keepers. Hereditary religion that you are born into, not converted. They do not seek out other believers. All ideals are viewed as respectable in the way they are pursued.
