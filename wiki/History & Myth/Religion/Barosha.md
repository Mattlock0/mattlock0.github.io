Worshipers of the [[Ancient|Ancients]]. This religion found prevalence in the early years of [[Ancient]] interaction with man but has since fallen out of graces. While most people revere the [[Ancient|Ancients]] as messengers of the Architect, they do not worship them as gods. Those within Barosha attribute divinity to the [[Ancient|Ancients]], not the Tree or its creator. They believe that the [[Ancient|Ancients]] were the ones to mold Hearth and its inhabitants, including the Tree they live on. Their “holy land” is Summit, and they believe those who are versed in the [[Ancient]]’s sight will gain their reborn state above the clouds.
