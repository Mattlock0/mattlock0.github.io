**Agonn** is a sort of anti-[[Religion]] of [[Northern Hearth]].

Anti-religious folk that do not believe in a god. They value Veins above all and rely strictly on their own strength. In early years, this belief was not readily-accepted due to the abundance of evidence for the existence of some sort of supernatural, reigning force in Hearth. But as the Keepers recede and the Weaver hides, Agonn has gained more and more prevalence.
