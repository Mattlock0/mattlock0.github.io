**Tree Folk** is a [[Religion]] in [[Northern Hearth]].

A group of people (or a society) that places the highest respect in the Tree and its “children,” all other trees. They will not disturb any tree that is living and view it as heresy to build anything on or of them. They will move their homes and buildings elsewhere if a tree grows within.

The Tree Folk believe that all people are the sentient children of the Tree (and that the Tree itself is sentient) and that Veins are an extension of the Roots. They praise those with Veins as "Chosen" because the Tree chose them to continue to nurture the world.
