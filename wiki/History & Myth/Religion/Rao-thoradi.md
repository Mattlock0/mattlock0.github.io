**Rao-thoradi** is a [[Religion]] in [[Northern Hearth]].

The main religion on [[Oligarchy of Baro-Sassan]], the Rao-thoradi follow the precedent set by their mythological figure [[Kavat]] and treat nature with the utmost respect. Attempt to clean up after other’s messes. See the world as a series of parallels, just as Kavat was a two-fold person struggling between physical and spiritual (himself and the Wanderer). They see him as the Great Maker who was inevitably split by his creation into preservation and destruction.

Their initiation comes in the [[White River]]. Young [[Sassani]] are brought to the White River and baptized in its waters, and arise with glowing blue eyes and the Sight. This allows them to see most of what all the Veins can see, as well as a little into the Plane housing Identity. They call it Kavat’s Hand, as though he is every day protecting them from the heat and cold.

The Rao-thoradi believe water is sacred and the White Oases are holy land. They make it their goal to live out the preservation half of Kavat in hopes that it will outweigh the destruction and bring Kavat back to his center. Birthed from [[Leyn Orsev|Leyn’s]] protection of life.
