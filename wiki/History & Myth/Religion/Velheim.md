**Velheim** is a [[Religion]] in [[Northern Hearth]].

The Vellheim do not have a godhead. While they revere the mythological figure who staked his life on the Field of a Thousand Blades, they do not attribute any divine nature or godhood to him. Instead, the Warrior-God at their head is more figurative than fact. They believe the afterlife consists of the culmination of one’s Vocation—the primary focus of one’s efforts in life—in a final test within the Final Halls. They contain the final remnants of The Architect’s original call to man to follow the Paths. Fueled from Riddem’s legacy.
