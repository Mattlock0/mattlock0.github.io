The Seats are the seven most respected Knights in Eldenguard. While usually made up by the Lord Marshal, Sentinel, and Generals, any Knight can become a Seat. The elevation to Seat was done through a series of challenges to keep oneâ€™s position, but that became exclusive once the other Paths wished to join. Now, a representative from each Path must remain on the Seats at all times and is expected to be the highest-achieving in their Path. There are two slots reserved for the Lord Marshal and his Sentinel, four for each of the Paths, and one that continually changes hands.
## First Seat (Lord Marshal)
**[[Guren Voluster]]**
A rank above commander general, the Lord Marshal is responsible for overseeing all Knights and communes directly with the Lord Regent. All global decisions involving the Knights go through him. Once it has been achieved, it is a lifelong office with a cutoff at sixty-five. Each lord marshal has a sentinel who will one day serve as their replacement. If both the Lord Marshal and Sentinel die, a trial is hosted between all commander generals for a replacement.

The current Lord Marshal Guren Voluster has been in this rank for seven years. He achieved the rank of commander general in five years. He was close with the old Lord Marshal Osirus, and when his sentinel died Guren was chosen to replace him.
## Second Seat (Sentinel)
**[[Wyrran Verullian]]**
The current sentinel is Wyrran Verullian, and he serves as right-hand man to Lord Marshal Voluster. He is both an Elite and a Captain, serving joint Paths as he stands by the Lord Marshal and may one day take inherit his position. If this happens, Wyrran would leave the Champion path entire as Guren did before him.
## Third Seat
**Leon Kaiser**: Paladin Champion
## Fourth Seat
Therose Holt: Western Carlen General
## Fifth Seat
Segart Nordhaus: Eldenguard Corporal
## Sixth Seat
William Hugo: War Savant
## Seventh Seat
Wenrin Telfrine: Stand-In Intica General
