The [[Knights|Knights]] are an [[Arden]] [[Faction]] originating in [[Regency of Arden|Eldenguard]] that governs and polices [[The Arden Alliance]]. They are ruled over first by [[Xander Fulgard|Lord Regent Xander]], and then by [[Guren Voluster|Lord Marshal Guren]].

The Knights of the Alliance are a group of soldiers, ambassadors, nobles, and researchers that are organized under one umbrella of command. While being structured like the military, the Knights essentially make up the acting government of the Arden Alliance.

By technicality, being a Knight does not usurp the privilege of one’s heritage. However, performing as a Knight—through advancements, tactical decisions, or gaining more land—can elevate one’s position and “compensate” for a lack of heritage. Many kinds try to join the Knights for the benefit it affords.

They were first formed as a group called the Knights Twelve sworn to the Lord Regent’s and to expand Eldenguard’s domain. The Knight Takeover led Eldenguard to subjugate Carlen, Intica, and fragments of Threyda. Once Arden expanded to three distinct provinces, one king of old realized they needed to become more than just soldiers. So, he made them to be something more.
## Iconography
A Knight’s allegiance is symbolized by a crest, which they must always wear on their person. It also serves as their permit and badge of identification. Falsifying one of these is considered a capital crime.

There are individual crests for office and for specific Guilds, but the crest of a Knight is that of a hexagon split in three: one with a sword, another with a book, and the third with a flag.
### Path Icons
Each path also has its own designated icon, all including red feathers. Generals have straight red feathers adorning their pauldrons, creating a sort of mantle over their shoulders. Champions have a metal red feather embedded into their ceremonial swords. Savants have flat caps with a red feather attached on the back.
## Standing Army
Among the three unified regions of Arden, there are nearly 200,000 crested Knights. They mostly come from Eldenguard, and some are pulled from Carlen, while a small group were taken from Intica. They are split by land size and a dash of prejudice, where 89k (45%) reside in Eldenguard, 69k (35%) reside in Carlen, and 39k (20%) reside in Intica. The Entics do not take kindly to Knights inhabiting their land and keep most of them out.

Most Knights are not war-ready, and the largest army ever strung together for war waging was nearly a hundred years ago against Threyda, consisting of 35k Knights, and was heralded by their Lord Marshal at the time.
## Duties of a Knight
Knights are responsible primarily to the Lord Regent. They protect him at all costs, loyal to him against any other source, and fight wars for him. However, they have other duties beyond that. Knights are made primarily of nobility, and as such are elevated above undrough.

Their duties include keeping peace in the three regions of Arden, settling disputes between civilians, being Honorbearers for promises and “oaths” (such as wedding proposals and trade deals), though these are not Axis-bound ones. They may also be called to recruit more Knights, be a stand-in House representative, seek out and “recruit” more Veins, guard Arden towns from invasion, and spy/gather information in other kingdoms.

Higher Knights in the system—namely second ranked paths and above—are expected and required to be the foremost leader in their House or are the upcoming leader if their parents have not yet passed on the mantle. Other Knights, when not taken by their standard duties, may be called upon to represent another House and master their Tenants. This duty is not usually given to a high-standing Knight.\

## Terms of Battle
1. When a fight to the death is issued, both fighters give the other their true name. In this way, the name of he who loses is not forgotten, but engraved in the victor’s heart. These battles are known as “true battles,” and serve as a Contract born between either warrior to see it through to the end.
2. Upon being victorious, the winner sticks his opponent’s weapon into the ground, blade first, as a symbol of their battle and pride. It is taboo to take a warrior’s blade from them, even in death or defeat.
3. Scars are an honorary part of battle. Covering them up is an act of cowardice.
4. Those who interrupt a true battle between warriors cast shame on their honor.
## Guilds
Most Knights are not on battle duty. They have guard positions spread across the Alliance and take up their own projects. After a House lobbied to have access to a group of Knights for the construction of their Hold, the Knights later turned around and lobbied for the ability to form Guilds, groups which could take on their own official projects with Knight funding.

Guilds run somewhat autonomously, but are not outside of Knight law.
