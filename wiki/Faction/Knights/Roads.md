There are many paths a Knight can follow, not only one of combat. Every Knight begins as a gallant and ascends to a knight. Once they pass that threshold, they choose whichever path suits them best. Each path has its own system of ranks, and [[Knights]] can progress through milestones respective to that path.
## Champion
The first Path is one of physical prowess, called the champion. Knights on this path are allowed to pursue their own skill with the blade and are expected to be masters of combat—both one on one and against multiple opponents—and of working with a team of other champions.
## Savant
Researchers and scientists who focus on one field. The field of study could be medicine, biology, sociology, venology (study of Veins), or even strategy. Many savants are called upon in wartime to develop weapons or advance tactics. Despite a focus on research, those on the savant path are still required to meet the knight’s threshold of physical ability.
## Acquisitor
Acquisitors have the political training of an ambassador and the intent of a spy. They are sent not only throughout Arden but to other kingdoms to collect information and report it back to the Lord Regent. They are responsible for tracking down new recruits, learning advancements in magic and technology that other kingdoms have made, and plucking secrets from their people. An unacknowledged path in the Knights; they are usually “Commanders”.
## General
Knights who have shown leadership potential and wish to serve a higher function than battle. Knights on this path can be recommended from any other path, but most reach it naturally by working toward it. They work in administration or by leading troops into war. Each level is given charge of more Knights, and their commands outrank those of the same level in other paths.
## Ranking System
### Gallant
Starting rank within the Knights. They serve as squires to a knight, learning their ways, and how to fulfill the duties of a Knight. Once they prove their loyalty, resilience, and mettle, they are given a recommendation by their knight and are elevated to knight themselves. Gallants tend to move on quite quickly, especially of late. The requirements of a knight grow loose, and the Lord Regent is in need of many new knights to replace dead ones.
### Knight
The first Crested rank in the Knights. A Knight swears an Oath of Fealty to a House leader of Tenth Age or above. Such a knight’s opportunities and responsibilities open up at once, being that their next step will take them into one of the paths. Knights are given all the base advantages, being that they can advance their House’s status, be a licensed guard for money, and serve the Lord Regent in royal events.

Many champions and captains will take knights into unofficial guilds—a habit that partially upsets the command structure, but one that is tolerated by higher-ups. Many guilds have their own agendas, though all are under reign of a corporal or commander general.
### Road of Decision
Once a knight has proved themselves, they are called to take a second Trial and are presented with the potential paths they can pursue. Some knights are not given the option of a path and are kept as knights, but most successful knights have a path forward. From here, they split under four different paths, each with their own ranks:
### Champion Path
#### Lance
The first step to champion, these knights have provided exemplary service and dedication to honing themselves and their skills. Most lances are specialized in a particular style.
#### Elite
Though an elite is the second of three steps to becoming a champion, many consider achieving it only one fourth of the process. Once a lance is elevated to an elite, the real trial begins. Elites are expected to help train other knights and lance, be masters of two weapon types, and to go on scouting missions to exterminate [[Valkrin]].
#### Champion
A leader in battle and holds enough sway to take groups to war if need be. Well known and respected in the Knights, besides being a weapons master and a well-accomplished fighter. Unlike the other paths, there can technically be an unlimited number of champions. Because of this, however, the bar to become one is set high. There are currently only six in the Knights.

They work with a crew of elites, ranging from 6-10 knights, when training and undergoing missions.
### Savant Path
#### Specialist
Specialists are expected to keep up their physical strength as much as their mental strength. Just starting out, specialists can dedicate themselves to one field of research until they prove themselves there. However, general study into other fields is encouraged and, at later points, required for specialists to advance.
#### Adeptist
An adeptist is, as their name suggests, learned in one area of research, and have made advancements in that field. They present their ideas to savants and complete their own research to propose potential advancements in their field of research. However, at this point an adeptist is expected to have a cursory understanding of each field.
**Savant**
To become a savant, an adeptist must prepare a dissertation on something they wish to contribute to the five fields: war, biomechanics (magic and medicine), engineering, culture, or philosophy. If accepted by a committee of savants in that field, they may be accepted into the field. Some savants, later in their lives, have straddled two fields and written dissertations on an advancement that can bridge the gap. There can only be five savants for any field at one time, thus the limit is currently twenty-five. However, if an adeptist proves particularly talented, exceptions are made.
### Acquisitor Path
#### Delegate
The first step to becoming an acquisitor. Delegates are usually hired into a captain’s role publicly and given a small team to work with but are given specific duties and travel opportunities that require them to strengthen their intercultural abilities and seep into the lives of other kingdoms.
#### Superior
A delegate is never elevated to superior publicly, but when they receive the promotion, they are given the title of corporal. As corporals, they have the option for more administrative work, which gives them time to dedicate to scouring maps, reading up on the cultures of Northern Hearth, and sharpening their skills of observation and analysis. Many superiors spend their time outside of Eldenguard.
#### Acquisitor
By the time a Knight has become an Acquisitor, they have surpassed their public perception and integrated into their work entirely. Most are known to be out of the country for an extended period, or are simply absorbed in their work, though they may be anywhere at any time. They return to Eldenguard intermittently with the information they have acquired, then return to whichever field they have been sent into. In outer circles, the Acquisitors are known as a “guild” called the Regent’s Own and serve both as bodyguards in times of need and spies for him whenever he needs them to track down information.
### General Path
#### Captain
This rank consists of knights who have proved themselves as leaders. They are given a small troop of knights and have the authority to direct lances when necessary. When an attack occurs, they are the first to take charge—whether to lead the defense themselves or to hand it off to a corporal or commander general.

Captains are responsible for one platoon, which ranges between 15-45 Knights. They may be rotated between platoons to test their skill, but usually are given charge of one and stay there until elevated to corporal.
#### Corporal
Granted the authority to command captains and elites. Corporals have a select group of captains and knights under their direct command whom they can send out to complete tasks.

Corporals are responsible for one company, ranging from 100-1,000 Knights. Usually, they are situated in one region and given reign there until elevating or retiring.
#### Commander General
Granted authority over an entire region of Arden as well as the authority over corporals and, in times of crisis, champions. There are five: two for Eldenguard, two for Carlen, and one for Intica. They report directly to the Lord Marshal but are given rights to make major decisions when fitting.

Commander generals are responsible for one division, consisting anywhere from 2,000 Knights to 30,000. Strictly assigned via region. There may be five within the Knights at any given time. There are two assigned to Eldenguard, two to Carlen, and one to Intica.
