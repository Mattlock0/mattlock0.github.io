## Arden Fleet
The Arden fleet is quite sparse and is made up of only 21 ships. Some part of the Elden Nature has a fear of the ocean and depths, particularly when they cannot see the bottom. Therefore, there are not many sea-able Knights, and were mostly pulled from Intica, then Carlen.
- Wartreader (1) can support a crew of 150 men.
- Knolls (3) can support a crew of 60 men.
- Carracks (7) can support a crew of 40 men.
- Cogs (10) can support a crew of 20 men.
- Skimmer (~20) can support a crew of 10 men at most, but requires at least 5.
## Individual Equipment
The Knights are outfitted with a variety of weapons inspired by the united regions of Arden. When a gallant is elevated to knight, they are given a pinsteel, the classical Elden weapon. An equivalent weapon would be our rapiers, though a pinsteel has a thicker, edged blade and no knuckle guard.

Depending on their designation, Knights could also be given crossbows, glaives, or daggers. They are primarily outfitted with halberds, especially when on guard or patrol duty.

During sieges or field battles, the Knights employ catapults, shields, and plate armor against their foes. There are some magic weapons also used (like cornerspikes, used by solid controllers) but most are useless unless in the hands of a Vein.
