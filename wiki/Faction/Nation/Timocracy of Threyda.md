This kingdom’s land has been mostly taken over by Arden. They refuse to be ruled by the Alliance’s Lord Regent and have kept up resistance for over a century. They have built a large wall surrounding their country to keep intruders out. Remnants of the wall can be found in Carlen to the north of Paelholm. That mountain used to belong to the kingdom of Threyda and was their base of operations.
## Government
A secretive, once-confederation that was unified after the Council Twelve was murdered by the Alliance. Currently Jhavod Asvin is their warchief. Their society places a heavy focus on the Twelve Ideals, and particularly the number twelve.
