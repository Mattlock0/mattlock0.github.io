The **Republic of Tiereth** is a [[Nation]] in [[Northern Hearth]] which is based in the eastern half of [[Tiereth]].

The East and West regions of the once-prosperous kingdom of Tiereth were split in two after a war within the nation. Once the two lands were separated, leaders of either war stepped up to rule them. Before the separation, they used to speak an ancient language called Tirethic, but have been forced to reform to the global language to do trade.
