The **Regency of Arden** is a [[Nation]] in [[Northern Hearth]] ruled by the [[Arden]].

The fourth continent was originally new land for many as they settled into their lives. But later, the Eldens rose to unify then under one rule. They trampled and scoured and pillaged, all for the eventual sake of unifying the land. They eventually succeededâ€”that is, without Threyda.

Known as the Kingdom of the Sun because they built their capital in a bald patch of the Tree, giving them lots of sun. There is a reverse area in Summit where no leaves grow, and the archria see it as a cursed place.

The Alliance (which consists of Eldenguard, Carlen, and Intica) is a Unitary State where the monarch of Eldenguard holds all the power and delegates small decisions to the leaders of Carlen and the chieftains of Intica.
## Elden Province
Capital province of the Regency of Arden. This province houses the ruler of Carlen and Intica. Similar land structure as Carlen, yet with less fertile soil. There are many resorts and cities based on the vast shoreline surrounding Eldenguard. While not trading anything, it has a wealth of resources to benefit the royalty living there.
>*Name Origins: German & Roman*
### Governance
A regency, where the Lord Regent, [[Xander Fulgard]], rules in the stead of the lost line of their king. He stands over the Closed Chamber of Houses, which makes rulings and dictates to The Common Chamber.

Arden is a classist society with Houses taking up the nobility and [[Undrough]] as the lower class. The dichotomy is nowhere more obvious than here, where undrough Tenants serve nobles for a chance at elevation.
## Carlen Province
The region which makes up the majority of the Kingdom of Arden. A land of plains and forests with plenty of land to farm and construct towns. Mountains rise up to the far northeast and southwest, but the majority of Carlen is fairly flat. While the area close to Eldenguard is prosperous, the far east does not share such richness. It is often referred to as the Undersociety and considered the slums. It is outside the direct influence of Eldenguard, and thereby mostly ignored.
>*Name Origins: Dutch & English*
### Governance
Ruled in name only by [[Devian Strate]], the serving baron of Carlen. However, the [[Knights]] and [[Houses of the Alliance|the Houses]] are the reigning enforces and lawmakers over the Carlen province, respectively.
### Foundry Cities
As nomads, the Caelish did not have homes, and manual labor required them to be in one place for an extended period of time. To support this, the [[Pavers|Pavers Guild]] was formed to raise cities using Veins. They did not do a particularly good job of it, often creating slapdash, unplanned cities of stone in a matter of months that caused many deaths. However, it provided ample housing, and led to their penultimate accomplishment: [[Sonmore]].

Even as their creations crumble in their wake, the [[Pavers]] move onto bigger and better projects. Knights guard Foundry Cities, complaining about missing walls, crumpled houses, and suffering undrough.
## Intica Province
A jungle and forested region which is mostly untouched. It is under the rulership of Arden, but few villages spot the cluttered landscape. Those who _do_ live in Intica, however, are well-off from its rich soil and various exotic plants and fruits. In turn, they try to reach out to those in the Undersociety to help them get back on their feet. It has yet to be fully overtaken by the Kingdom of Arden due to the river separating Intica and Eldenguard. It has been tried before, but Intica has defended their land from the spreading Ardanian blight.
### Governance
Each tribe in Intica has their own thing, but it seems like small religions and traditions ripple through the region on a monthly basis.
