The most neutral of any country and kingdom. Avoids war like the plague. They refuse alliances with any other state in fear of being caught in a war with another country over it. While not having the most lucrative exports, they do have a mining colony in the southern part of their kingdom. Also, there are ruins in the northern area of their province, referred to as the Snake’s Head. The ruins contain ancient technology left by an advanced race known as the [[Ancient|Ancients]].
## Government
Perholt is ruled by an Aristocracy.
### Military
They have a score of knights and military leaders, but they rarely make war on other nations due to their lackluster navy. Most of the scholars dictate against war, but it hasn't stopped smaller skirmishes from building in the Middle Strait.

Their elite forces are religious, believing the taking of life to be a divine calling and a sacred rite. Before a battle, they hold their blades horizontal across their face and kiss the blade. No life is to be taken in anger. It is every man’s responsibility to bury their mark.
#### The Blades of Celt
There were twelve blades forged at their birth, and there are only ever twelve Blades at any one time. Should one die, their squire picks up the sword in their place. Succession can only occur when the Blade dies.

For the Blades, killing is their legal jurisdiction. But they never kill without choice, without council. It is considered a crime to run from a Blade that seeks your life.

The Blades all wear heavy crimson cloaks. The symbolism is that should you do anything, mean it. Do not move without intention.
