## Noteworthy Places
### Axis Tree and Dragon Isles
A set of three islands at the pole of Northern Hearth housing the Axis Tree. Unlike Earth, the Axis Tree creates a warm pole full of life, a welcome change from the cold outer rim of Hearth. However, any explorer who dares get close to the Axis Isles has, out of an intense fear or reluctance to get closer, turned around and retreated.

Due to the Axis Tree’s energy, their pole is warm and full of life. However, since the cruel god the Weaver ascended, Tyragnia and Dalmiurge surge the outer two islands with Arcane Vis every ten years. They create strong lightning and fissures in the ground to stop any curious explorer from getting close.
### Solaria Archipelago (Solari)
A small kingdom between Baro-Sassan and The Axis Tree. Ships traveling between the two often stop by for rest and restocking. The archipelago is a prominent business and trade location, making it easy for people to make money selling things to seafarers. Their sand is also well-known as the finest in the world. A tourist location.

### Marrion Reach (Marri)
While technically a part of Dreyynir, they are situated so far away from the capital that Dreyynir’s democracy doesn’t have much of an effect on them. They are a free-trade, free land set of islands. All are welcome to participate in their multitude of festivals. Generally, the people of Marrion Reach are known as free-spirited and kind. Whenever officers from Dreyynir’s capital try to enforce the law, they get caught up in the caring nature of Marrion Reach’s people.
*Name Origins: Icelandic, Finnish*
### Kantian Principalities (Kantic)
A bunch of islands ruled by a stuck-up prince. This “kingdom” is very strict about foreigners and barely allows any in. They are self-sufficient and avoid trade with other kingdoms and provinces. Is not recognized as a kingdom by any other nations.
*Name Origins: Russian*
### Fallen Kingdom of Artem (Arte)
A kingdom that fell when its king passed away without a successor. The citizens, how few there are, live in anarchy. It is avoided by most. Some of the inhabitants band together to raid the coastal cities of Western Tiereth. Long ago, it was known as Drateria, but after falling it was renamed to Artem.
*Name Origin: Ukranian*
