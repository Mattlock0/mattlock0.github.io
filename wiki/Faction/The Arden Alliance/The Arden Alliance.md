**The Arden Alliance** is a [[Faction]] of [[Arden]], [[Caelish]], and [[Entic]] people based in [[Regency of Arden|Eldenguard]] and collected under [[Xander Fulgard|Lord Regent Xander]]. The other regions gathered beneath the Arden Alliance as of 981 KR are Carlen and Intica.

Currently heralded as the Northern-World superpower, Eldenguard is the capital of the largest landmass, reigning over Carlen, Intica, and most of what used to be the land of Threyda. Their Lord Regent, Xander Fulguard, rules over all three provinces from [[Lothrame]], the capital of Eldenguard. All those within [[Lothrame]] are of the upper class.

By the common man, called The Elden Dominion for the true origin of the Alliance. Casually called The Dominion or The Alliance.

Started with Eldenguard and their original king Elden Velguard. He renamed their country to Eldenguard (with excessively petulant arrogance) to analog their focus of protecting him and his family. Elden also established the heritage system which has survived to this day.

With the coming years and rulers, Eldenguard took to laying siege on Carlen and their capital Trantel. After years of conflict (and one dead king) in the Dominion War of 1522, Carlen finally joined to the growing kingdom of Eldenguard. Through a "treaty" written out by Eldenguard, Carlen would keep their name and their current leader would have a say in their business, but they would officially join the "Elden Alliance" and be governed by Eldenguard and their king. This also gave [[Knights]] power in their land.

Later, The Elden Dominion (as the Caelish began to call it) expanded its borders to Intica through the bloody Greenvine War of 1578, after which the separate clans of Intica were also bullied into the Dominion.

When the original Velguardâ€™s line was cut short, a proposition was made that the leading House should reign over the Alliance. As such, the Lord Regent was born, the name chosen as a constant reminder that the position is temporary and falling from it could mean everything. The escaped Velguard descendant was never found.
## The [[Undrough]]
The [[Undrough]] class are citizens of Arden that are not members of [[Houses of the Alliance|The Houses]]. Houses are established by a drop of blood encased in glass and stored in [[Lothrame]]. Any house above the Fifth Age is required to have a full Hold in [[Lothrame]].

Most [[Caelish]] and [[Entic]] people are considered [[Undrough]].

Quickly after taking over [[Carlen]], the [[Arden]] put them to work. They quickly offered those with Veins a place in [[Lothrame]], while those without they left to do manual labor across the continent.
