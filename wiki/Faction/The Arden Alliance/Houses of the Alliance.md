As heritage is held in such high regard in the Alliance, many families have formed “Houses”: conglomerates of families who intermarry and share legacies. If you’re a part of a large, wealthy, and well-renowned House, your power—even in legal matters—greatly increases. Many of the top families in Eldenguard are heads of Houses, competing against each other for a shot at true royalty: Regency. When a couple is married in Eldenguard, they take the family name with the longest standing heritage. If a son marries up, his House is combined into his wife’s. This is rare between powerful Houses. Only daughters are married up.

Most Houses have a “foothold”—often called a Hold for that reason—in Eldenguard while their own territories are elsewhere. They trade in different goods because they have land in other parts of Carlen and Intica. Usually, only the head family lives in the Elden Hold while the weaker families reside in the outer territory.
## House Ages
Heritage is all-important to the Elden. They count power in their country by a family’s Ages. The amount of pure-blooded eras the family has been present in Eldenguard with a Hold to call their own, the stronger their claim is on the land and position in the world.

The Houses are split into two, in relation to their overall power within the Alliance. First and foremost are [[The High Houses]], and beneath them are [[The Low Houses]].

Houses can lose pure Ages if they get into a scandal—and more specifically, when they're caught—so other nobles spend too much time spying on others to uncover dark secrets, even going so far as to make them up. That’s where the Chamber comes into play.
### The Closed Chamber of Houses
A group of the High Houses constructed to settle disputes between the Houses that the [[Xander Fulgard|Lord Regent]] or [[Knights]] cannot (or should not) handle. They can (and have, multiple times) be bribed, and Houses with higher Ages literally have more sway when it comes to voting. As the Closed Chamber have delegates with at least 10 Ages, each one’s voting power is decreased by 10.
### The Common Chamber
Any House, guild, or business not Tenth-Age or above is represented in the Common Chamber. Each of those listed above is allowed one delegate of their choosing. In the Common Chamber, they are discuss matters of the kingdom not proprietary or critical enough for the Closed Chamber of Houses to handle.
### Gaining Reputation
A House gains one Age every generation it is established in Eldenguard (with a sanctioned Hold) and is lead by a Vein. While the Elevation of Houses is a tradition discussed by the Chamber every five years, they have (mostly) strict rules to stop bias.

One way to grow one’s Age early is through the Knights. By representation, a Knight can work for other Houses, doing good in their name, for them to give the Knight’s original House an Age in recompense, showing fealty to the nobility and Eldenguard as a whole. There must be a five-Age different for a Knight to perform representation, and for that Knight to awarded an Age they must have served under the House for at least a year.

Usually, non-magical children are pushed into the Knights (full of contempt and shame), which is why they end up being so corrupt. Many Knights will use their position to spite their magical siblings. Other Rootless children and “disposed of” to cull the weak and keep a bloodline “pure”.
### Losing Reputation
If a leading member of your House is found doing, or accomplishing any of the following, the House can lose from one to as many as three Ages: (or may not be given an Age during Elevation)
- Be caught in a scandal (the Chamber decides how many pegs it knocks you down)
- Breaking the law (generally, “law” and “breaking” can be debated)
- Social taboos (marrying an undrough (impure), openly having undrough slaves, )
- Being barren (haha sucks loser)
- Murdering another House leader
## House Trade
All Houses have a foothold in some trade, whether it be import or export, and produce such a trade to distribute it to the other countries and areas of Eldenguard. The types are listed below.

Lumber, stone, coal, marble, leather, furs, horses, farm animals, meat, fish, eggs, spices, salt, sugar, grain, crops, seeds, honey, oil, water, wine, beer, soil, clay/bricks, sand, glass, ink, dye, wool, cotton/linen, paper, rope, brewery, iron, palladium, Ferrite/charged Ferrite, Derelon, Keridium, monetary metals, Chronite(?), jewels, Bottled Knowledge (something that contains and transfers memories of the three types: procedural, semantic, and episodic), [[Axial Wood]], Heartwood (rarer & harder), exotic substances, jerofane (addictive painkiller), araphen (safer numbing agent; addictive in larger quantities), pure mixed air, refineries, purifiers, Mind-Snapped [[Valkrin]], composite minerals, mechanical creations, weapons, tools, armor, Steamshots (in book 2), and Steelarm Suits (in book 3). (Something producing heat/light)
## Tenants
Those in lower-class Houses can improve their family’s standing by serving a higher House. These Tenants are paid minimally, but their primary reason is to gain recognition by their betters. If they strike back against their masters, they are thrown out of the system and lose the chance to improve that generation’s standings.

This has led to immense corruption in the more powerful Houses as they mistreat their Tenants with no real consequences. There are a plethora of reasons why Tenants are brought on, from cooking to cleaning to…darker reasons, but most are not fair in the slightest. However, the promise of a better future for their descendants gives those in the program hope.
