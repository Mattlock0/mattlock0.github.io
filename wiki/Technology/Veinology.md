**Veinology** is a [[Technology]] in [[Northern Hearth]].

Steamguns, cortan glue, slate chests, cornerpieces (singular Solid tool for picking up things), [[Anchor Plate]] (self-locking armor that allows a vein to stand while using their powers)
## Concepts
Flashforging (melting metal, Controlling it to a shape, then cooling it/dunking it in animal oil), particulation (breaking something into parts to make it harder to Anchor)
## Vein-Fueled Transportation
### Ships
A set of Liquid Controllers stand near the base of the stern and boil the water behind them. This propels them forward.
### Solid Islands
Solid Founders carry a chest of ice with them and throw chunks into the ocean, then grow them outward as necessary to create a path. Their power allows them to carve straight runs, but they need to drop a new anchor every so often.
### Node Paths
Eventually, they discover how to use Root Nodes to create a system of ice paths across the ocean that activate when fed Vis.
## Undiscovered
Root batteries, Vis circuits, [[Pherinol|bonerot]] knives, flux-powered flight, slate infusion/cores
