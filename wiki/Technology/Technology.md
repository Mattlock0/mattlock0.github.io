**Technology** is a core component in [[Northern Hearth]]. During [[Peacemaker]] days, they are in a late medieval period with some renaissance thrown in there. From [[Last Among Heroes]] on, they leap into an industrial revolution.

The contents of this folder dictate the technology at the time of [[Peacemaker]], or the [[Age of Fate]]. Technologies from the [[Age of Destruction]] are labeled. In Earth years, Hearth is at around 1350 AD.
