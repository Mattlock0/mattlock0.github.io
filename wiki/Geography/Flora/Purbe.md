**Purbe** are [[Flora]] in [[Northern Hearth]].

Similar to a Venus fly trap, the purbe flower grows a singular, white berry at the center of its bloom. Small critters are attracted to it, seeing the sweetness of its life essence, but once they try to grab it the purbe snaps shut. Can make lacerations on human skin if they stick their finger into its center.
