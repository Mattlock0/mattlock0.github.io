**Kaefofil** is a [[Flora]] in [[Northern Hearth]].

When crushed and consumed, it has a numbing effect on pain. In higher concentrations, it can dull the senses and emotions. Used to create [[Heirofane]], a drug with addictive tendencies that is essentially a souped-up painkiller.

It smells strangely sweet, a little sharp, and musty.
