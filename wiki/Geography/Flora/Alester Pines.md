**Alester Pines** are large [[Flora]] in [[Northern Hearth]].

Trees with web-like leaves that can be used to filter particles from the air. The fragments it catches in the wind clump up and fall to the treeâ€™s base, where they are absorbed for nutrients. A very sturdy evergreen plant able to survive wherever wind blows strong. The leaves themselves are fragile and, when they contain too many nutrients from the air, fall off.

They are particularly tall evergreen trees with sturdy crimson bark and can live for thousands of hundreds of years.
