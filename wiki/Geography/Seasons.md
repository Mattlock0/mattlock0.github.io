## Season of Blue
Spring in our world. Lasts for 90 days. Leaves begin to grow back on the Tree, forcing out the chunks of ice formed in the Season of White. They melt under a new sun, forming rain which falls to Hearth. Thus the name of the season.
## Season of Green
Summer in our world. Lasts for 90 days. [[The Axis Trees]] are vibrant and full of life. Similarly, humans with Veins are filled to the brim with energy, having fully recovered from the Drought in the Season of White.
## Season of Red
Autumn in our world. Lasts for 90 days. The leaves of the Tree turn orange and red, thus the name of the season. In this season, leaves go through a metamorphosis, a quarter of them falling and the rest beginning to crystalize.
## Season of White
Winter in our world. Lasts the longest, at 95 days. The Axis Tree grows dim, its remaining leaves changing completely to ice. All possible energy is sucked out of them, leaving a hollow shell. Veined give their Vis up to the Tree, growing weak and unable to use their Veins to their fullest extent.

Maybe cycles? The Rain Cycle, Ice Cycle, etc.
