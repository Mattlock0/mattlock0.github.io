## Age in Earth Years
**1350 AD**
Which is, for us, near the end of the Dark Ages (476–1400 AD). There were 4000 years between Creation and Jesus’ birth, which means the current “age” would be 5350. However, the Flood happened in 2348 BC, meaning civilization would be best matched up to 3698 years of growth.
## Growth of Hearth
Due to their access to magic, Hearth advanced a little faster than Earth did. This also contributed to wars with worse consequences, but it evens out to a 12% increase in growth, meaning they discover technologies 12% as fast. Meaning, the age of Hearth (with Seradese) is roughly 3254.
## Planet Statistics
Their planet is tilted 48 degrees. Because of this, winter and summer are longer and the days are shorter/longer at the solstices. Summers are survivable under the Tree but winter is terrible. Solar eclipses are much rarer.

Light and heat are major commodities in Hearth and plants are tougher, resilient things that require less sunlight. Animal meat and products are the primary sources of food. The Roots produce both heat and light, but those who are not lucky enough to be established on one have to find other means. Some have developed synthetic means of producing heat, particularly Radiant Founders, who can blossom heat from the smallest candle. Heat must be produced by the Tree during winter and absorbed via the leaves during summer.
## Axis Tree Dimensions
The radius of the root barrier is 3,000 miles, which makes the area of Northern Hearth around 28 million square miles. The root barrier has Flux roots which repel gravity in a ring, pushing the branches of the Tree up from the sides like a wall and stopping anyone from leaving via a wave of energy.

[[The Axis Trees]] are around 24,000 feet (4.55 miles) tall. At the top, it’s around -26 degrees F. An Axis Tree’s crest can be seen from around 2,575 miles away. It breaks the cloud barrier at about 9,000 feet, the branches (Summit) begin at 14,000 feet, and the Crown starts at 23,000 feet. Humans can breathe up to about 20k feet.

An Axis tree has a diameter of about 79,200 feet (15 miles). That makes its outer circumference around 497,600 feet (94.25 miles). It would take roughly 31 straight hours of walking to round the Tree, assuming you didn’t take detours for Roots.

The walls of the Tree are about 6,000 feet (1 mile) thick. That leaves the inside of the Tree with a circumference of 68,640 feet (13 miles). However, the central 5 miles of the Tree is taken up by its core, which makes the area between the walls and the core roughly 4 miles across. This could be walked in about an hour and 20 minutes.

Assuming steps are around 8 inches tall—and a person can climb about 1.3 steps per second (78 steps (52 feet) per minute)—you could climb to the Axis Crown using stairs in 462 minutes straight (7.7 hours) of walking. But the height of the Axis Tree is not made of just stairs. With plateaus, rests, and hurdles, it would take one about a week to reach the top.

The last 1,000 feet—the Axis Crown—would take 19 minutes to scale.
## Nexus Tower Dimensions
A parallel to the Axis Trees, the Nexus Tower is around a mile tall.
## Map Information
Each hexagon in the hexcrawl is 6 miles across.

## Supported Population (by landmass)
In England during the Middle Ages, there were about 3.7 million people contained within 50,301 square miles, or 73.5 persons per square mile. Which means the following kingdoms can (roughly) support these populations if they were packed as tightly as England was:
 - **Eldenguard**: ~63 million (45 million)
 - **Carlen**: ~57 million (33 million)
 - **Intica**: ~39 million (21 million)
 - **Threyda**: ~ 27 million (19 million)
 - **Perholt**: ~50 million (40 million)
 - **East Tiereth**: ~34 million (15 million)
 - **West Tiereth**: ~57 million (34 million)
 - **Artem**: ~4 million (2.5 million)
 - **Dreyynir**: ~112 million (86 million)
 - **Marrion Reach**: ~10 million (8 millon)
 - **The Northern Isles**: ~4 million (3 million)
 - **Kantian Principalities**: ~6 million (4.5 million)
 - **Baro-Sassan**: ~182 million (7 million)
 - **Solaria Archipelago**: ~10 million (5.5 million)

On a whole, they are not tightly populated. Places like Tiereth and Dreyynir are very mountainous, and so cannot support as much as Carlen could with the same square mileage. The actual populations are in parentheses. Average land conversion: 28.31%

> Although Baro-Sassan is large—almost as large as the Sahara Desert—it is also nearly as uninhabitable. Their only saving grace is the White River, whose water they can carry with them to keep them cool.
## Moon Temple Math
$TidalForce = Amplitude \times sin(Frequency \times T) + Phase$

Frequency: How long it takes for the moon to orbit the planet.
Amplitude: Strength (related to gravity) of the moon’s effects on the tide
Phase: Move it around to synchronize the moons
T: Time from the start of the cycle(or x when plotting)

All the effects of the moons together to see their effect on the tides. Once you have that, figure out how long it takes each moon to orbit, and how large they appear in the sky. Then you should decide how that effects time cycles (months, years, etc).

This means that Hearth has to be more sizable than Earth to support eleven moons. Earth has a gravitational force of $\approx 9.79 N$ on a $1 kg$ object at the equator ($6,378 km$). Hearth, on the other hand, has a mass of $9.2*10^{24} kg$, meaning that exerts a gravitational force of ~$15 N$ on a $1 kg$ object at the equator ($6,378 km$). Therefore the force of gravity on Hearth is around $1.5 G$, or $14.71m/s^2$.
