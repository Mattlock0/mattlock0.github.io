**Terkan** are Mammal [[Fauna]] that can be found in [[Northern Hearth]].

A brutish load-bearing animal common to the Arden continent. They have four thick legs like tree trunks and stand low to the ground. They move slow yet steadily, and are covered in long yak-like hair. Their horns branch and curve forward so they can sweep the ground. In their domestic area, the grass is thick and little creatures tend to live on the stalks, letting their swipes kill multiple at once for them to eat.
