**Wardik** are Mammal [[Fauna]] that can be found in [[Northern Hearth]].

Red-season predators that mainly hunt bren. They have no eyes and instead seek through large ear canals on their faces and wiggling prodders that can sense vibrations in the ground. Their prodders are retractable, and claws can extend out. They dig through the ground to hunt down their prey.
