**Fereen** are Mammal [[Fauna]] that can be found in [[Northern Hearth]].

Lithe deer-like mammals that have large flat teeth for cracking harder [[Carlen]]-native nuts and some of the smaller, armored creatures. Theyâ€™re omnivores, but they usually eat grass and leaves.

Have long, bushy tails that can be used as camouflage.
