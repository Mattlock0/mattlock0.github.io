**Snowbren** are Mammal [[Fauna]] that can be found in [[Northern Hearth]].

The smaller, less intelligent cousins of the [[Bren]].

Small, White-season fauna that munch on the dying plant life. Very territorial but tend to clump together when met with a large foe. Sleep during Blue, Green, and Red. The embodiment of laziness in Hearth as they sleep the majority of the year and go back to snoozing when they tire themselves out. Creatures with little intelligence except for their pack instincts.
