**Northern Hearth** is the northern hemisphere of the planet [[Hearth]] that exists around the Northern [[The Axis Trees|Axis Tree]].

Northern Hearth is currently in its late medieval/early Renaissance period, and as such is on the brink of the [[Age of Revolution]]. However, it is restrained by [[the Weaver]] and his grip on civilization.
