The **Ghost Foresters** are a [[Species]] of [[Northern Hearth]] and strictly residents of the [[Ghost Forest]].
## Physical Features
Ghost Foresters have pale, slightly transparent silvery skin. Most have heterochromia, usually with red or blue in their large irises. Their eyelids are clear so it appears that they do not blink. However, they have clear eyelids so that they do not have to readjust to the low light levels of the Ghost Forest, and to keep the [[Ghost Particles]] out of their eyes.
