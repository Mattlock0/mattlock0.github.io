**Replyte** are a [[Species]] of [[Northern Hearth]]. They originated from [[Riddem Luther|Riddem]] and [[Dimirius Haksven|Dimirius]] and make up the [[Threydan]] culture.
## Physical Features
Replytes are a unique race of shapeshifters that change based on the deaths of their Connections. When born, Replytes have dark skin, orange eyes, and slender features. But when someone close to them dies, the [[Splinters]] embedded within them have a profound effect on their appearance and mind.

Adults can withhold this process and choose to stop themselves from being affected, but they cannot *force* a physical change.

The sorts of things that can change based on Splinters (organized from easiest to hardest) are:

- Eye color/hair color
- Skin tone
- Eye/ear/eyebrow/nose/mouth shape
- Hair texture
- Facial hair genes
- Height
- Body type
- Memories
## Spiritual Features
Replytes are born with a Nature of Endure and Hope and an affinity to [[Willpower]]. Their Nature boosts their Connections, making them passionate towards other people. They have an innate compassion for community, fellowship, and helping others.
