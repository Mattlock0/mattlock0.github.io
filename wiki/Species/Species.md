All species on [[Northern Hearth]] originate from [[Leyn Orsev|Leyn]], [[Riddem Luther|Riddem]], and [[Dimirius Haksven|Dimirius]] at the [[Conflux]]. Over time, Veins and their Connections with the land have changed their physiques in order to help them survive on Hearth and adapt to the changing climate beneath the [[The Axis Trees|Axis Trees]].
## Primary Races of Hearth
Of the many species of Hearth, five make up the majority of all people on it. Three of these groups are direct descendants of the [[Pinnacle Three]] while the other two are combinations of Riddem’s offspring and the men’s.

- [[Hadrill]]
- [[Tebrene]]
- [[Sennti]]
- [[Madrian]]
- [[Replyte]]
## Uncommon Races of Hearth
In certain extreme regions and situations the originator species diverged to create strange, warped counterparts. Most are extinct, but some of which still roam the land of [[Northern Hearth]]. Unlike the species, these can usually be found only in their native regions.

- [[Ghost Forester]] ([[The Ghost Forest]])
## Species Origins
The regions of the world were based on the three survivors of Seradese: [[Leyn Orsev|Leyn]], [[Riddem Luther|Riddem]], and [[Dimirius Haksven|Dimirius]]. They were the templates for three races: the Threyn, Derr, and Eimon respectively.

From the Threyn people grew those of Tiereth, Artem (Threyn/Derr), Threyda, and the Kantian Principalities. [[Leyn Orsev|Leyn]] was also the foundation of the major religion Rao-thoradi.

From the Derr people grew those of Dreyynir, Baro-Sassan (Derr/Threyn), Intica (Derr/Eimon), and Solaria. [[Riddem Luther|Riddem]] was also the foundation of the major religion Vellheim/Vellmire/Vellminyne.

From the Eimon people grew those of Carlen (Eimon/Derr), Eldenguard, and Perholt. [[Dimirius Haksven|Dimirius]] was also the foundation of the major religion Alteck (and Din, but it has since been destroyed).
