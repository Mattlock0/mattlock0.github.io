**Madrian** are a [[Species]] of [[Northern Hearth]]. They originated from [[Riddem Luther|Riddem]] and [[Leyn Orsev|Leyn]] and make up the [[Entic]] and [[Kantian]] cultures.
## Physical Features
Madrian have dark skin, thick eyebrows, and light-colored eyes, usually green. They have sharp, hardened spikes on their elbows (made from keratin) and long, deep nailbeds that can carve into [[Axial Wood]].

Madrian are more connected to [[The Axis Trees]] than most, and as such are reliant on photosynthesis as well as food and rest to create energy. If they are away from the sun for too long, they become lethargic and can fall unconscious easily.
## Spiritual Features
Madrian are born with a Nature of Conviction and Wrath and an affinity for [[State Veins]]. Their affinity allows them to connect to [[The Axis Trees]] through the [[Roots]] and see the “paths of the world”, which are shadows of the [[World Line]] and the ruts that plants, animals, and weather fall into.

Madrian can consume a piece of [[Axial Wood]] and have it to grow in their stomachs to allow them to always see these paths.
