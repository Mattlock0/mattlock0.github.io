**Hadrill** are a [[Species]] of [[Northern Hearth]]. They originated from [[Dimirius Haksven|Dimirius]] and make up the [[Arden]], [[Haltess]], and [[Arte]] cultures.
## Physical Features
Hadrill are tan-skinned with thin eyebrows, sharp cheekbones, and often dark-colored eyes. Their eyes are telescopic and allow them to zoom in on things in the distance or focus on small details. Many also have long, straight-bridged noses.

Hadrill bear tattoos that magically grow on their backs and form based on achievement. The sort of achievement changes depending on their [[Connection]] with [[Truth]], and can be from societal beliefs and reputation to heritage and family success. The tattoos *can* disappear over time if the achievement is proved null.
## Spiritual Features
Hadrill are born with a Nature of Dominion and Understand and an affinity for [[Fate]] and [[Truth]]. Their Nature pushes them away from those who are not Hadrill and drives them to establish systems and truths that they can grow and manipulate.
