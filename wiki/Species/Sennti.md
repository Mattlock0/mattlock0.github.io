**Sennti** are a [[Species]] of [[Northern Hearth]]. They originated from [[Riddem Luther|Riddem]] and make up the [[Sassani]] and [[Dreyyn]] cultures.
## Physical Features
Sennti have a range of darker skin tones from light brown like tanned leather to black, like coffee. Sennti usually have shorter lifespans in exchange for not having to sleep as long and having tougher nails and hair.

Sennti also have natural armor if they allow their hair to grow, creating natural swirling armor. Most Sennti only have hair in the usual places to protect their most vital parts, but some Sennti (mostly those living in [[Democracy of Dreyynir]]) can grow hair anywhere. Their natural armor can be broken down with a simple compound, but it is not exchanged or even known about by outsiders.

Sennti also have thin, gill-like rivets under their armpits and breasts that act as water storage and sweat pores to help with hot and cold. When storing water from the [[White River]], Sennti can expend it to temporarily protect themselves from fire. The heated gel which runs through the [[Strontius Caves]] and comes from [[Roots]] in Dreyynir grant resilience against the cold.

They are also like camels, in that they can store fat for warmth and energy and burn it to create water.

Their bones are denser, making them tougher but heavier, so many Sennti have trouble swimming. Many Sennti also have flat, squarish nostrils.
## Spiritual Features
Sennti are born with a Nature of Mastery and Change and an affinity for [[Willpower]], [[the Sight]], and [[Source Veins]]. They have an innate desire to protect the land and nurture it, leaving it better than they found it.
## Subrace, Marri
Marri have lighter skin than their eastern relatives, and reside mostly in [[Marion Reach]]. They are shorter than most Sennti, but they have longer legs. Also have less dense bones in exchange for an easier time swimming.
