The **Tebrene** are a [[Species]] of [[Northern Hearth]]. The Tebrene originated from [[Leyn Orsev|Leyn]] and make up the [[Caelish]], [[Undrough]], and [[Tyrean]] cultures.
## Physical Features
Tebrene have pale skin, dark hair, and tend to be tall. They also have a high sensitivity to vibrations, and with training could develop a level of echolocation with the thin webbing in their ears. Tebrene also have large lungs which can heat up the air they breathe in, allowing them to survive easier in the intense cold.

Most Tebrene have thin skin which allow some to breathe *through* it. This makes them excellent Breath Veins, but hydration is a much more important factor for them, becoming deadly to them much faster than for others.

A strain of red hair runs through the Tebrene in East Tiereth.
## Spiritual Features
Tebrene are born with a Nature of Rally and Protect and an affinity for [[State Veins]] and [[The Heart]]. Successive children born to Tebrene have different strengths chosen at seemingly random by a Tebreneâ€™s genes.
